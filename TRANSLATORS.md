If you want to create a translation for PyTextMonitor it is great.

First you should get a source text. It may be found on [github](https://github.com/arcan1s/pytextmonitor) (path is `sources/ptm/po/pytextmonitor.pot`) or here is a [direct link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcan1s/pytextmonitor/master/sources/ptm/po/pytextmonitor.pot).

Then copy the source file (`pytextmonitor.pot`) to `xx.po`, where `xx` is short name of selected language (for example, `en`) and edit it. I use `lokalize` for it, but you may use any text editor (just put translated text into double quotes in lines `msgstr""`). But I think that using any special editor (such as [lokalize](kde.org/applications/development/lokalize/) or [poedit](http://poedit.net/)) is more comfortable. Examples of finished files you may find in [the repo](https://github.com/arcan1s/pytextmonitor) too (path is `sources/ptm/po/`, files are `xx.po`).

If is is possible README should be translated too (it will be included in the package). You may edit it in any text editor as a plane text using [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The source file may be found in [the repository](https://github.com/arcan1s/pytextmonitor) too (path is `sources/readme/en.md`, [direct link](https://github.com/arcan1s/pytextmonitor/blob/master/sources/readme/en.md)). The recommended name of output file is `xx.md` (since it uses markdown).

If you have a github account you may fork [my repo](https://github.com/arcan1s/pytextmonitor), create a translation and then create a pull request. If you do not have one you may send me files in any convenient manner ([via e-mail](mailto:esalexeev@gmail.com) too).
