pytextmonitor
=============

PyTextMonitor is a minimalistic Plasmoid script written on Python2. It looks like widgets in awesome-wm.

HOWTO
For edited output you must open Settings window and setup output format in lines:
  label "$uptime" means uptime, ---d--h--m
  label "$cpu" means total load cpu, %
  label "$ccpu" means load CPU for each core, %
  label "$cpucl" - average cpu clock, MHz
  label "$ccpucl" - cpu clock for each core, MHz
  label "$temp" - average temperature in system (if doesn't work please let me know)
  label "$gpu" -GPU usage, %
  label "$mem" - usage memory, %
  label "$memmb" - usage memory, MB
  label "$swap" - swap, %
  label "$swapmb" - swap, MB
  label "@@/@@" (in hdd label) - mount point ('/' in example) usage, %. Separator for mount points list is ';', for example "@@/;/home;/mnt/global@@"
  label "@@/dev/sda@@" (in hddtemp label) - HDD ('/dev/sda' in example) temperature
  label "$net" - download and upload speed, KB/s. You may also specify the number of devices (1 or 2) - without their names. And you may specify network device: something like @@eth0@@
  label "$netdev" - current network device
  label "$bat" - battery charge, %. Battery device may be set below. File ("/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity" by default) must contain only battery charge in percent
  label "$ac" - status AC device. Return (*) if AC device is online or ( ) if offline. AC device may be set below. FIle ("/sys/class/power_supply/AC/online" by default) must contain '1' if AC is online
Label order will changed if you change slider position. HTML tags in label work normally.
Attention: you don't may set to show $cpu in swap label for example. $cpu will work only in cpu label.
